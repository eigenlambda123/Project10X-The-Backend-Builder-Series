# Project10X: The Backend Builder Series

A structured, hands-on journey through 10 backend projects designed to progressively build and deepen practical backend development skills using Django and Django REST Framework.

## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of 10 backend projects, each chosen to introduce new concepts, technologies, and challenges relevant to modern backend development. The projects cover a broad range of topics including authentication, API design, real-time communication, CLI tools, web scraping, and basic natural language processing.
