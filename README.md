# Project10X: The Backend Builder Series

A structured, hands-on journey through 10 backend projects, designed to progressively build and deepen backend development skills using Django and Django REST Framework.

---

## Overview

This repository documents a curated sequence of backend projects developed to explore modern web development concepts in a practical, incremental way.

Each project focuses on production-style backend architecture, and includes:

- Core CRUD and RESTful logic  
- Backend tests (unit and API-level) using Djangoâ€™s test framework  
- A minimal frontend built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript  
- Optional stretch goals for deeper exploration or feature expansion

Projects are structured to reflect real-world systems rather than isolated examples, with an emphasis on clean code, modular design, and practical experience.
