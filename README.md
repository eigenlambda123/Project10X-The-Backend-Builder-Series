# Project10X: The Backend Builder Series

A structured, hands-on journey through 10 backend projects designed to progressively build and deepen practical backend development skills using Django and Django REST Framework.

---

## Overview

This repository contains a curated sequence of 10 backend projects, each selected to incrementally introduce new concepts, technologies, and real-world challenges relevant to modern web development.

The projects cover a wide range of topicsâ€”from core CRUD APIs to advanced features like asynchronous communication, user roles, and even basic machine learning integration. The goal is to learn by building complete, production-style systems, not just isolated examples.

Each project includes core features and optional stretch goals to encourage deeper exploration.
